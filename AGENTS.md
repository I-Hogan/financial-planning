# Agent Instructions

## Documentation First

- Always read relevant files in `docs/` before making changes.
- When you update code, also update the related documentation in `docs/`.
- Keep `README.md` in the project root up to date with changes.

## Working Guidelines

- Keep changes scoped to the task.
- Prefer small, clear edits over large rewrites.
- Note any assumptions or open questions in your response.
